### Features

* Ready-to-use already styled solution for quick implementation;
* Default and custom media messages;
* Fully customizable layouts - setting styles out of the box (use your own colors, text appearances, drawables, selectors and sizes) or even create your own custom markup or/and holders for unique behaviour;
* List of dialogs, including tete-a-tete and group chats, markers for unread messages and last user message view;
* List of messages (incoming and outcoming) with history pagination and already calculated dates headers;
* Different avatars with no specific realization of image loading - you can use any library you want;
* Selection mode for interacting with messages;
* Links highlighting
* Easy dates formatting;
* Your own models for dialogs and messages - there is no converting needed;
* Ready to use message input view;
* Custom animations (according to RecyclerView usage).
